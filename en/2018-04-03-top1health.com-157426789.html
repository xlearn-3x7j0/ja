He personally visits and encourages all the athletes, and he called on the group to sign up for 2018 before the end of April. To win the game, a smoke will not be drawn from May onwards. Not only will it win health, but it will also have a chance to win big prizes. At the same time, Commander-in-Chief and Director Wang also wear a volunteer strap and an open flag for the six major team captains.</span>">交通部常務次長祁文中及衛福部國健署署長王英偉，關心全國24萬名小客車職業駕駛的健康與辛勞，親自蒞臨鼓勵所有運將，並呼籲4月底前率先揪團報名參加2018「戒菸就贏比賽」，5月起一口菸都不抽，不但贏得健康，還有機會抽大獎；同時祁次長及王署長也為6大車隊隊長配戴義工背帶及公開授旗。</p>

<p data-translation="<span>Wang Yingwei, Director of National Health Administration, said that according to the 102-year National Health Interview Survey, professional drivers (including minibuses, taxis, minivans, buses, buses, tour buses), large trucks, connecting vehicles, and trucks aged over 18 were found. The smoking rate was 56.2% for drivers who were driving etc., which was higher than 18% of adult smoking rates in the same period (102 years). Now the adult smoking rate has dropped to 14.5%, and the smoking cessation actions of professional driving friends are in no hurry.</span>">國民健康署署長王英偉表示，根據102年國民健康訪問調查結果發現：18歲以上的職業駕駛(包括小客車、計程車、小貨車、大客車〔公共汽車、遊覽車〕、大貨車、連結車、貨車駕駛等之駕駛員）的吸菸率為56.2%，高於同時期(102年)成人吸菸率的18%，現在成人吸菸率更已下降至14.5%，職業駕駛朋友的戒菸行動刻不容緩。</p>

<p data-translation="<span>Huang Weixin, MD, said that because of the nature of the work, transporters will often mistakenly believe that smoking can refresh and relax. In fact, nicotine is an addictive substance that causes the user to have physical dependence and it is addictive. Similar to heroin and cocaine, smoking refreshment is short-lived. In the long run, it will worsen the spirit and make people more annoyed. Concentration will be needed to drive a car, especially if it is not suitable for smoking.</span>">黃偉新醫師表示，由於工作性質的關係，運將經常會誤以為吸菸可以提神及放鬆，事實上，尼古丁是成癮性物質，會讓使用者產生身體上的依賴，其令人成癮的程度與海洛英、古柯鹼類似，吸菸提神是短暫的，長期下來反而會使精神更差、人更煩躁，運將開車需要專注力，尤其不適合吸菸。</p>

<p data-translation="<span>Lin Murata, chairman of Taiwan’s Grand Prix Team, said that since the team’s inception, they have attached great importance to the health of the athletes, so the big teams have joined the cessation of smoking in 2008 to win public charity campaigns and encourage colleagues to quit smoking. Currently, the team’s team is nearly one-third of the time. Drive smoking and roughly estimate that more than 5,000 people smoke. It was touching to see that the registered colleagues were willing to work hard for themselves and their family to stop smoking.</span>">台灣大車隊董事長林村田表示，自車隊創辦以來，就非常重視運將的健康，所以大車隊從2008年加入戒菸就贏比賽公益宣導、鼓勵同仁戒菸，目前大車隊近3分之1的駕駛吸菸，粗估5千多人吸菸。看到報名的同仁願意為自己與家人努力斷絕菸癮，令人感動。</p>

He immediately signed up to “quit smoking to win the game.” In May, he did not smoke a cigarette, not only for 1 month.
