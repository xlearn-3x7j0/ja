<p data-translation="<span>(3, Seibu 7-4 Softbank)</span>">（３日、西武７－４ソフトバンク）</p>

<p data-translation="<span>Softbank's Higashihama has suffered six disappointments lining up at his own worst. I did not allow one runner up to four times, but the ball got sweeter at the sixth in 1 point difference, and it got reversed like taking 2 two runs. &quot;It was a waste just because I was stolen in the first half (a sixth time) I was more careful than usual but I could not throw it.&quot;</span>">　ソフトバンクの東浜が自己最悪に並ぶ６失点を喫した。四回まで１人の走者も許さなかったが、１点差の六回に制球が甘くなり、２本の２ランを浴びるなど逆転された。「前半粘れただけに、もったいない。（六回は）いつも以上に注意したが投げきれなかった」</p>

<p data-translation="<span>Having raised 16 wins last season, his right arm won the first victory. Seibu warfare was also good with 4 wins and 1 loss last season, with a protection ratio of 2 · 02. However, even in the 2 army fight a week ago when it became adjustment adjustment climb, it was 8 runs in the middle five times. I could not step on the main points with my own early riding this season I grew with anxiety.</span>">　昨季１６勝を挙げ、初の最多勝に輝いた右腕。西武戦も昨季４勝１敗、防御率２・０２と好相性だった。しかし、調整登板となった１週間前の２軍戦でも五回途中８失点。不安を抱えたまま迎えた自身の今季初登板で要所で踏ん張れなかった。</p>

<p data-translation="<span>In the first team in the four games from the opening, there is no winning star yet. Director Kudo said, &quot;(six times) was a bit less powerful, if I changed a little earlier, my mistake.&quot;</span>">　開幕から４試合で先発陣に、いまだ勝ち星がない。工藤監督は「（六回は）少し球威が落ちていた。もう少し早く代えていれば。僕のミス」と話した。</p>
